    description: "St. Michaël’s church is one of the prettiest churches in the area. This church was constructed from 1406 until 1466 on the spot where once used to stand a small Romanesque church. The church was converted into a three-aisled hall church in the style of the Lower Rhine Gothic. Its 120 meter high tower was the highest in the country for a long period. But, due thunderstorms, the tower collapsed and was not rebuild.",
