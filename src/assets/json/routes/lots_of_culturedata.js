The inner gate building shows a special view between the two fortification towers on the field side where the enemy was surprised with boiling pitch and oil. The round holes under the windows on the upper floor were used for falconets or "snakes" where burning fireballs were thrown down. The defense is made for the use of bow and arrow, crossbow and spears. In order to prevent damage by exhaust gases, driving under the gate has been prohibited since 2010. The gate now serves as a pedestrian road.',
