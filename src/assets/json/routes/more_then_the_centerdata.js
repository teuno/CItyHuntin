    description: "Isala is a hospital group in the IJsselland (Isala is an old Latin name for IJssel), and consists of 2 hospitals, the largest in Zwolle and a smaller one in Meppel. Isala originated in the early 21st century as a merger of the catholic hospital De Weezenlanden, just outside the canal to the south of the city center, and the Sophia hospital on the Ceintuurbaan. The Weezenlanden was eventually demolished, while a new hospital was built at the Sophia hospital, while the Sophia hospital was gradually being demolished. It is one of the larger hospitals in the Netherlands, and the largest non-academic hospital, with approximately 1,116 beds, where almost all medical specialties are represented.",

    description: "Passiebloem windmill, the Passion Flower windmill, is the name of an oil mill with storage barns from 1776. The mill stopped producing in 1928 and was subsequently purchased by the municipality of Zwolle. Until the Second World War, the mill was used as a storage place. In the thirties, the Municipality of Zwolle had the mill restored in the context of an employment project for the unemployed. During the war, food for the soup kitchen was prepared here. In 1965 the mill was restored and the sails started turning again, but due to lack of money the maintenance was a problem which caused the mill to deteriorate rapidly. In 1984 De Passiebloem was restored again, after which it was put into use again on 11 May 1985. Now is working just twice per month.",
